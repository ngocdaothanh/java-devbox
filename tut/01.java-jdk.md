# Java, JDK

## Java

* A language (a set of syntax)

## JDK

JDK = Java SDK

SDK = Software Development Kit:
* Standard libraries
* Compiler, to compile `.java` files (text files) to `.class` files
  (bytecode binary file for JVM to run)

JDK is a software package containing:
* JRE
* Compiler

## JVM

JVM = Java VM

VM = Virtual Machine

JVM loads `.class` files and run the specified `main` function (entrypoint of the program).

## JRE

JRE = Java Runtime Environment

JRE is a software package containing:
* JVM
* Standard Java libraries

## JDK vs JRE

* JDK: for developers to write and compile Java programs
* JRE: for users to run compiled Java programs
* JDK is bigger than JRE

## Typical developement worlflow

* Use text editor or IDE to write your Java program in `.java` files.
* Use Java compiler (in JDK) to compile `.java` files to `.class` files.
* Use JVM (in JDK or JRE) to run your `.class` files.

## Popular versions of Java in 2025

* Java 8: minimum version you should use in 2025
* Java 21: LTS (Long-Term Support) version;
  companies like to use LTS version because
  they are stable, and supported at 5-10 years to come;
  "supported" means securites bugs (in JVM!) are fixed quickly
