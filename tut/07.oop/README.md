# 4 principles of OOP

## Abstraction

Abstraction is the most important principle.

"Program to interfaces, not to concrete classes."

The purpose is to create the structure/skeleton of the program.

2 ideas:
* Interfaces
* Abstract classes

## Encapsulation

* For bundling variables and functions together
* Data hiding: we should always access the private data via public methods

## Inheritance

For code reuse.

## Polymorphism

We have a collection of items,
and the behaviour of each item depends on the concrete class of the item.
